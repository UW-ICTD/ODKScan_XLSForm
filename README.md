ODK Scan XLSX Form generator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a client-side javascript application for generating scannable paper forms
from XLSX spreadsheets. Scannable in the sense that the app generates a template
that can be used with ODK Scan to automatically read which bubbles are filled in
like a scantron test.

There is some documentation [here](http://uw-ictd.github.io/XLSXGenerator/documentation.html)
