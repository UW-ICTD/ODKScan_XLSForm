h1. Getting Started

    There is an example spreadsheet available "here":scanExample.xlsx which you can use a starting point.
    To add a question create a row like this:

| *type* | *name*   | *label*            |
| text   | user_name| What is your name? |

(Below in the XLSX Format section many other types, columns and settings are described.)

p.
    When your spreadsheet is ready upload it and you will see a preview of the generated form.
    You will also see a download link appear for the ODK Scan form definition.
    You can print your form by printing the webpage (only tested in chrome), or by printing the jpegs included in the form definition folder.

h1. XLSX Format

The form converter expects workbooks with 3 sheets: survey, choices and settings.
They are individually described in the sections below.
Most spreadsheet programs have controls in the bottom-left corner where you can create them.

h2. survey

    All XLSForms require a survey sheet.
    The survey worksheet contains the structure and most of the content of the form.
    It contains the full list of questions and information about how they should be presented.
    Most rows represent a question; the rest of the rows specify control structures such as groups.

Example survey sheet:

| *type* | *name*   | *label*            |
| text   | user_name| What is your name? |
| integer| user_age | How old are you?   |

h3. survey sheet columns:

h4. type

| text   | Write-in text input. |
| integer| Integer (i.e. whole number) input.|
| decimal| Decimal input. |
| note   | Displays a label with no input. |
| select_one `choice_list` | Multiple choice question; only one answer can be selected. |
| select_multiple `choice_list` | Multiple choice question; multiple answers can be selected.|




h4. Scan specific types:



| tally `number`     | Print the specified number of bubbles, and count up how many are filled in. |
| markup             | A label that only appears on the printed form.                       |
| bub_num `digits`   | Create a field for inputting numbers by filling in numeric bubbles   |
| bub_word `letters` | Create a field for inputting words by filling in alphabetic bubbles. |
| qrcode `data`      | A QR code containing the given data. Used for keeping track of variations of a form that share a template. |
| pagebreak          | Pagebreaks allow you to create multi-page forms.                     |

h4. Groups:

Groups are drawn as columns. Nested groups are drawn as rows within a column. For example:

| *type* | *name*   | *label*            |
| begin group| | |
| note| | This is in the left column |
| begin group| | |
| note| | These are |
| note| | in rows in  |
| note| | the right column  |
| end group| | |
| end group| | |

h4. name

The name sets the variable the answer is stored under.

h4. label

    The label is typically the question you want to ask.
    Labels can contain HTML for formatting, however this formatting will be removed when it is viewed in Collect.
    For example, if you want to set the label to use a custom font, you could do something like this:

<pre>
<code>
<span style="font:12px times;">I'm a stylish label.</span>
</code>
</pre>

h4. default/constraint

    When scanned forms are exported to Collect the default and
    constraint columns can be used to set default values to be entered as answers,
    as well as xpath constraints on the answers.

h2. choices

The choices sheet allows you to specify choices for use with `select_` type questions.

Example choices sheet:

| *list_name* | *name*  | *label* |
| cities      | seattle | Seattle |
| cities      | paris   | Paris   |
| cities      | new_york| New York|
| cities      | mumbai  | Mumbai  |

h3. choices sheet columns:

h4. list_name

The list_name is used to group choices into lists that can be referenced from the survey sheet. The example above could be referenced as follows:

| *type*           | *name*        | *label*                       |
| select_one cities|cities_visited | Which cities have you visited?|

h4. name

The name sets the value that the choice is stored as. This is useful in constraint formulas, and for formatting exports.

h4. label

Label sets the text that is drawn next to each choice bubble. There is a limited amount of space for them.

h2. settings

Example settings sheet:

| *setting*    | *value*                         |
| form_title   | Example Form                    |
| font         | 12pt Verdana, sans-serif        |

h3. settings sheet columns:

h4. form_title

This sets the form title displayed at the top of the form.

h4. font

This sets the form's overall font.

h4. title_font

This sets the font of the form's title

h1. Extra notes

    "The Form Generator site can be downloaded here for offline conversion.":https://github.com/nathanathan/ODKScan_XLSForm/archive/gh-pages.zip
    The offline version has one limitation if you view it from your filesystem:
    Due to a security restriction the default fiducials will not appear in the template file,
    so it is necessairy to replace them all with custom fiducials.

p. If you use the offline version, the formImage.css file can be altered to apply custom styles to the form images generated. If you need to condense yor form this could be an effective way to do it.
